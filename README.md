In a nutshell, `QPod` ( [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/qpod/qpod/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/QPod/docker-images) ) is **an out-of-box Data Science / AI platform at your fingertip which you would love.**

With Docker and `QPod`,
 - 📦 You will be set free from tedious environment settings, because `QPod` puts everything about installing and configuring Data Science / AI development environment into standard docker images which you can use in an out-of-box manner.
 - 🕵️‍ You can focus on your algorithms and key innovations because with the help of Jupyter ecosystem tools you are more close to data in an interactive computing manner.
 - 🌍🌎🌏‍ You will find sharing your work with other people much easier because the standard images make scientific research or data analysis project reproducible.
 - 🆙 You will find deploying your data science / AI projects much easier because you can use the images to develop your algorithms or programs, and then re-use these images easily either to provide RESTful APIs or orchestrate map/reduce operations on big data.

## What's actually there?

`QPod` curates and maintains a series of Docker images including interactive computing environment to run a Jupyter Notebook (or JupyterLab) with Python, R, OpenJDK, NodeJS, etc.

`QPod` supports many use cases:
 - (Stand-alone) Use it on your laptop as default data science / develop environment.
 - (Multi-tenant) Use it on a server/cluster to host multiple users to exploit hardware resources like GPU.
 - (Deployment/Production) Use it as the base image to host RESTful APIs or work as executors or map/reduce operations.

## How to use? `1-2-3-GO`🎉

### 0. Have docker installed on your laptop/server
Linux (Ubuntu LTS is a good choice) / Windows (>=10 recommended) / Mac.
 - If you are not using NVIDIA GPU, install [`docker-ce`](https://hub.docker.com/search/?offering=community&type=edition) or [`docker-ee`](https://hub.docker.com/search/?offering=enterprise&type=edition) on your laptop/server. We recommend you to use `edge` version ([macOS](https://download.docker.com/mac/edge/Docker.dmg) | [Windows](https://download.docker.com/win/edge/Docker%20for%20Windows%20Installer.exe)) on your laptop to enable Kubernetes features.
 - If you want to use NVIDIA GPU with `QPod`, Linux server is required. After installing `docker`, please refer to [`nvidia-docker`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker#quickstart) to install the latest version of NVIDIA support for docker.

### 1. Choose the features and choose a folder on your disk
See the table at bottom of this page (`QPod` feature matrix) and choose an Image Tag, say `full`.
Typically, if you have enough disk size and no worry about your network speed, you can choose `full` for your laptop or `full-cuda` for a Linux server with NVIDIA GPU.

Choose a folder (directory) on your laptop/server to server as the base directory (e.g.: `/root` or `D:/work`, please use an absolute path instead of a relative path).
Files in this folder are visible in the environment (and files outside this folder are not visible in the environment).

### 2. Start the container

For Linux/macOS, run command below in shell (change `full` and `/root` to your choices).
```
IMG="qpod/qpod:full"
WORKDIR="/root"
docker pull $IMG && docker tag $IMG qpod && docker rmi $IMG && docker images | grep qpod
docker run -d \
    --name=QPod \
    --hostname=QPod \
    -p 8888:8888 \
    -v $WORKDIR:/root \
    qpod
sleep 5s && docker logs QPod 2>&1|grep ?token=

```

For Windows, run the command below in CMD (change `full` and `D:/work` to your choices):
```
SET IMG="qpod/qpod:full"
SET WORKDIR="D:/work"
docker pull %IMG% && docker tag %IMG% qpod && docker rmi %IMG% && docker images | findstr qpod
docker run -d ^
    --name=QPod ^
    --hostname=QPod ^
    -p 8888:8888 ^
    -v %WORKDIR%:/root ^
    qpod
timeout 5 && docker logs QPod 2>&1|findstr ?token=

```

**If you are using `QPod` with NVIDIA GPU macines with `nvidia-docker`, please add option `--runtime=nvidia` in the `docker run` command to enable GPU access.**

### 3. Sit back for minutes and get the first-time login token
The commands in the last step will:
 - trigger a docker image download process which may take minutes
 - start a docker container named `QPod`
 - print a string contains a URL, which includes a 48-digit hexadecimal number

Please copy the printed hexadecimal *after* `?token=` as the first-time login token.

### Go! 🎉
Access `http://localhost:8888/` (or `http://ip-address:8888` if you use a server) in your browser and input the token you just copied to start the journey.

## Additional Information

### Hardware

The images are built based on `ubuntu:latest` and only tested on the `x86` platform.
Minor modifications are expected to port to `ppc64le` platform.

### Package Management

Although `conda` is installed, we do not recommend to use conda to install a lib/package, because:

- `conda` does not reuse the existing system library yet if a system lib is already installed, `conda` installs it again.
- `conda` does not provide a stable Linux system library repository yet, for example, some lib works well on `debian:jessie` but fail on `debian:stretch`.

### Customization

These images are highly customizable. If you find a system lib / Python module / R packages is missing,
you can easily add one in the `install_XX.list` in the `work` folder.
