In a nutshell, `QPod` ( [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/qpod/qpod/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/QPod/docker-images) ) is **an out-of-box Data Science / AI environment and platform at your fingertip which you would love 💕.**

With Docker and `QPod`, you
 - 📦📦📦 can start your data science / AI projects with nearly `zero configuration` - QPod puts everything about installing (latest) packages and configuring environment into standard docker images and set you free from these tedious work.
 - 🌍🌎🌏 will find your work more `easy-to-reproduce` - QPod standard images make scientific research or data analysis project as [reproducible pipelines](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-018-07196-1) and help you [share your work with others](https://doi.org/10.1038/515151a).
 - 🆙🆙🆙 can easily `scale-up and scale-out` your algorithms and key innovations - QPod help you move forward smoothly from the development stage to deployment stage by re-using these images to either to provide RESTful APIs or orchestrate map/reduce operations on big data.

## What's actually there?

`QPod` curates and maintains a series of Docker images including interactive computing environment to run a Jupyter Notebook (or JupyterLab) with Python, R, OpenJDK, NodeJS, Go, Julia, Octave etc. Other IDE-like tools (e.g VS Code, R-Studio) are also included.

`QPod` supports use cases of both research and production:
 - (Stand-alone) Use it on your laptop as default data science / develop environment.
 - (Multi-tenant) Use it on a server/cluster to host multiple users to exploit hardware resources like GPU.
 - (Deployment/Production) Use it as the base image to host RESTful APIs or work as executors or map/reduce operations.

## How to use? `1-2-3-GO`🎉

### 0. Have docker installed on your laptop/server - Linux (Ubuntu LTS is a good choice) / Windows (>=10 recommended) / macOS
 - Please install **Docker >= 19.03**: `docker-ce` ( community version & free: [Linux](https://hub.docker.com/search/?offering=community&type=edition&operating_system=linux) | [macOS](https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/Docker.dmg) | [Windows](https://download.docker.com/win/stable/Docker%20for%20Windows%20Installer.exe)   ) or [docker-ee](https://hub.docker.com/search/?offering=enterprise&type=edition) (enterprise version & paid) on your laptop/server. **Docker installed from default Ubuntu/CentOS repository probably doesn't work for GPU!**
 - If you want to use *NVIDIA GPUs* with `QPod`, Linux server is **required**. After installing **Docker >= 19.03**, please also install both the [`NVIDIA driver`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#how-do-i-install-the-nvidia-driver) and the latest version of [`nvidia-container-toolkit`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker#quickstart) to use the GPUs in containers.

### 1. Choose the features and choose a folder on your disk
See the table at bottom of this page (`QPod` feature matrix) and choose an Image Tag, say `full`.
Typically, if you have enough disk size and no worry about your network speed, you can choose `full` for your laptop or `full-cuda` for a Linux server with NVIDIA GPU.

Choose a folder (directory) on your laptop/server to server as the base directory (e.g.: `/root` or `D:/work`, please use an absolute path instead of a relative path).
Files in this folder are visible in the environment (and files outside this folder are not visible in the environment).

### 2. Start the container

For Linux/macOS, run command below in shell (change `full` and `/root` to your choices).
```
IMG="qpod/qpod:full"
WORKDIR="/root"
docker pull $IMG && docker tag $IMG qpod && docker rmi $IMG && docker images | grep qpod
docker run -d --restart=always \
    --name=QPod \
    --hostname=QPod \
    -p 8888:8888 \
    -v $WORKDIR:/root \
    qpod
sleep 10s && docker logs QPod 2>&1|grep token=

```

 ⚠️⚠️⚠️ If you are using `QPod` with NVIDIA GPU machines with `nvidia-docker`, be sure to:
  - Use **Docker >= 19.03** and the command `nvidia-smi` works well on host machine
  - Add option `--gus all` in the `docker run` command to enable GPU access (after `--restart=always`)
  - Use `IMG="qpod/qpod:full-cuda"` or other images with cuda support

For Windows, run the command below in CMD or [Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) (change `full` and `D:/work` to your choices, and Docker on windows doesn't support GPUs yet):
```
SET IMG="qpod/qpod:full"
SET WORKDIR="D:/work"
docker pull %IMG% && docker tag %IMG% qpod && docker rmi %IMG% && docker images | findstr qpod
docker run -d --restart=always ^
    --name=QPod ^
    --hostname=QPod ^
    -p 8888:8888 ^
    -v %WORKDIR%:/root ^
    qpod
timeout 10 && docker logs QPod 2>&1|findstr token=

```

### 3. Sit back for minutes and get the first-time login token
The commands in the last step will:
 - trigger a docker image download process which may take minutes
 - start a docker container named `QPod`
 - print a string contains a URL, which includes a 48-digit hexadecimal number

Please copy the printed hexadecimal *after* `?token=` as the first-time login token.

### Go! 🎉
Access `http://localhost:8888/` (or `http://ip-address:8888` if you use a server) in your browser and input the token you just copied to start the journey.

## Additional Information

### FAQ
For a list of FAQ or other information, please refer to the [wiki page](https://github.com/QPod/docker-images/wiki) of this repo.

### Hardware

The images are built based on `ubuntu:latest` and only tested on the `x86` platform.
Minor modifications are expected to port to `ppc64le` platform.

### Package Management

Although `conda` is installed, we do not recommend to use conda to install a lib/package, because:

- `conda` does not reuse the existing system library yet if a system lib is already installed, `conda` installs it again.
- `conda` does not provide a stable Linux system library repository yet, for example, some lib works well on `debian:jessie` but fail on `debian:stretch`.

### Customization

These images are highly customizable. If you find a system lib / Python module / R packages is missing,
you can easily add one in the `install_XX.list` in the `work` folder.

Might not be very useful as above but will server as base of other images.                                                                                            |

(We use `tensorflow` stack instead of `pytorch` or others.)                                     |
